To address this issue, a recent development introduces a new class of integrators known as low-regularity integrators. These integrators use the variation-of-constants formula and e...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Alexander Ostermann (University of Innsbruck, Austria)</div>\n        <img src=\"images/20210728174100_21425.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;right:0;top: 0;width: 30px;\">\n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3442.htm","retrieved":1755711706622},{"title":"Toward a Mathematical Theory of Deep Learning: Lessons from Personal Research","contents":"<div class=\"left time\">\n         <p class=\"t-1\"><span>Jul 07</span></p>\n        <p class=\"t-2\"><span>2025</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"info/1056/3390.htm\" class=\"right text\">\n        <div class=\"t-1\">Toward a Mathematical Theory of Deep Learning: Lessons from Personal Research</div>\n        <div class=\"t-2\">Abstract: A century ago, breakthroughs like relativity and quantum mechanics emerged from or developed alongside rigorous mathematical theories. Today's AI revolution presents a stark contrast: progress remains predominantly empirical while mathematical theory lags significantly behind.

The classic example is the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem, relating the existence of Hermite-Einstein metrics (a special metric on a vector bundle) to the algebraic notion of slope stability. More recently, new PDEs in various geometric settings have ...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Ruadhaí Dervan (University of Glasgow)</div>\n        \n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3302.htm","retrieved":1753239811972}]}
