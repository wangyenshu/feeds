Today's AI revolution presents a stark contrast: progress remains predominantly empirical while mathematical theory lags significantly behind. In this talk, I will share perspectives on current efforts to establish theoretical foundations for deep lear...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Weijie Su 苏炜杰 University of Pennsylvania</div>\n        \n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3390.htm","retrieved":1753239811963},{"title":"Dynamic Stochastic Variational Inequalities and Their Applications in AI","contents":"<div class=\"left time\">\n         <p class=\"t-1\"><span>May 30</span></p>\n        <p class=\"t-2\"><span>2025</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"info/1056/3335.htm\" class=\"right text\">\n        <div class=\"t-1\">Dynamic Stochastic Variational Inequalities and Their Applications in AI</div>\n        <div class=\"t-2\">Abstract:The dynamic stochastic variational inequality (DSVI) is an ordinary differential equation whose right-hand side is defined by the two-stage stochastic variational inequality (SVI). The DSVI provides a unified modelling framework for various applications in which dynamics, uncertainties and equilibrium are present. We show the existence and uniqueness of a solution for two classes of th...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Xiaojun Chen (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University)</div>\n        \n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3335.htm","retrieved":1753239811966},{"title":"Spectrum of Quasi-periodic Schrodinger operator","contents":"<div class=\"left time\">\n         <p class=\"t-1\"><span>May 16</span></p>\n        <p class=\"t-2\"><span>2025</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"info/1056/3334.htm\" class=\"right text\">\n        <div class=\"t-1\">Spectrum of&nbsp;Quasi-periodic Schrodinger operator</div>\n        <div class=\"t-2\">ABSTRACT: Quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators possess a rich background in quantum physics. From a mathematical perspective, they are deeply connected to diverse fields such as dynamical systems, fractal geometry, harmonic analysis, and number theory. In this talk, I will survey recent advancements in the study of the spectral properties of quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators, with a particul...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Qi Zhou (Nankai University)</div>\n        \n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3334.htm","retrieved":1753239811969},{"title":"Moment maps in complex geometry","contents":"<div class=\"left time\">\n         <p class=\"t-1\"><span>May 09</span></p>\n        <p class=\"t-2\"><span>2025</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"info/1056/3302.htm\" class=\"right text\">\n        <div class=\"t-1\">Moment maps in complex geometry</div>\n        <div class=\"t-2\">Abstract: A major theme of modern complex geometry is the relationship between solvability of geometric PDEs and algebraic stability conditions. The classic example is the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem, relating the existence of Hermite-Einstein metrics (a special metric on a vector bundle) to the algebraic notion of slope stability. More recently, new PDEs in various geometric settings have ...</div>\n        <div class=\"t-3\">Speaker：Ruadhaí Dervan (University of Glasgow)</div>\n        \n    </a>","link":"https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/3302.htm","retrieved":1753239811972},{"title":"Compact Lie algebras admitting integrable complex structures","contents":"<div class=\"left time\">\n         <p class=\"t-1\"><span>May 06</span></p>\n        <p class=\"t-2\"><span>2025</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"info/1056/3301.htm\" class=\"right text\">\n        <div class=\"t-1\">Compact Lie algebras admitting integrable complex structures</div>\n        <div class=\"t-2\">Abstract: With N.
